# successful_recognition
Part1: To be used in my main final year project
This program is used to recognise a person.
First, a database must be created using databaseconnect.py
Then generatedataset.py is used to create a face dataset. NOTE:: When inputting name and age,it should be between "". eg: input name: "test" , input age: "23"
preparedata.py is used to build the encoding.pkl which is the encoded faces.
recognisecamera.py is used to finally recognise the person in the frame.
